    <h2>Why I Prefer Cats Over Dogs</h2> 
    <p>Dogs are literally the best because they are super funny and hilarious. They are cute and will always be by yourside no matter what the situation is unlike cats... Dogs are esspecially cool because they have many working jobs that cats don't because they are lazy. Dogs can work as police officers, soliders, therapy and many more. Dogs always love on you and want to be with you since you are their world. Dogs come in many shapes in forms and will protect you no matter their size. A chihuaha will protect its owner no matter how dire the situaiton is. Dogs really are better than cats. Cats are cute I will give them that.</p>
